# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics Assessmentc - Peter Finnerty


## Instructions for Assessment

The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that you have achieved the learning outcomes of the module while also providing you with sample work to show prospective
employers. The overall assessment is split into the three components as detailed below.
The percentages beside each bullet point indicate the weighting of that item in your
overall mark. Note, however, that the examiners’ overall impression of your submission
may override the individual weightings where deemed appropriate.

### GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks – these are described
further down. The repository should contain the following:

#### 10%: 
A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks.

#### 10%: 
A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks
with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such
as data files and image files.

### Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.

#### 10%: 
A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library [3].

#### 20%: 
Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may choose
these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the
demonstrations are at your discretion – you may choose to have an overall spread
of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.

#### 10%:
Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

### Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following.

#### 10%: 
A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library [4].

#### 20%: 
An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which
it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are
met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.

#### 10%: 
Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.
